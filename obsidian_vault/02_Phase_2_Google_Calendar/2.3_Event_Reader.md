# 2.3 Event Reader
Status: - [x] Completed

## Description
Extend the Google Calendar service module with the ability to read/query events. This is the **read-side for the Morning Briefing** — it fetches today's schedule as structured data that gets passed to Claude for summarization in `4.2_Scheduler`.

## Files to Create/Edit
- [ ] `src/integrations/gcal_service.py` (update existing)

## Prompt for Claude
```
You are building **LifeOS Assistant**. This module is the **read-side for the Morning Briefing** pillar. It fetches today's calendar events as structured data that the scheduler (`4.2`) will pass to Claude for natural-language summarization. It does NOT format display strings — that's the LLM's job.

The file `src/integrations/gcal_service.py` already exists with an `add_event()` function and uses `get_calendar_service()` from `src/integrations/google_auth.py`.

Update `src/integrations/gcal_service.py` to add the following:

1. Create an async function `get_daily_events(date: str | None = None) -> list[dict]`:
   - If date is None, use today's date.
   - date should be in YYYY-MM-DD format.
   - Query Google Calendar for all events on that date (from 00:00 to 23:59 in Asia/Jerusalem timezone).
   - Use `service.events().list(calendarId='primary', timeMin=..., timeMax=..., singleEvents=True, orderBy='startTime').execute()`.
   - Return a list of simplified event dicts with keys: id, summary, start_time, end_time, description.
   - This structured output is consumed by `4.2_Scheduler` which passes it to Claude for summarization.

2. Handle errors the same way as the existing code (use CalendarError, proper logging).

Do NOT create a `format_daily_summary()` function — summarization is handled by Claude in `4.2_Scheduler`.

Do NOT remove or modify the existing `add_event` function. Only ADD the new function.
```
